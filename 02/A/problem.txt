Two lines of two columns. Each line is a round.

Total unique values would be: 

A Y
B X
C Z

First column is opponents move
Second column is your move based on stragegy

A = rock (opponent)
B = paper (opponent)
C = scissors (opponent)

X = rock (you),     score count = 1
Y = paper (you),    score count = 2
Z = scissors (you), score count = 3

Calculating the score:

Total score is the sum of your scores for each round.
You calculate your score for a single round as follows: 
   
    Score for the shape you selected (1, 2 or 3) +
    Score for outcome of round (lose = 0, draw = 3, win = 6) 

So for:

A Y => rock + paper, you win, score => 2 + 6 = 8  
B X => paper + rock, you lose, score => 1 + 0 = 1
C Z => scissors + scissors, draw, score => 3 + 3 = 6

Total => 8 + 1 + 6 = 15

1 2
2 1
3 3
